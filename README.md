# Texas public records opinion scraper 

This is a simple scraper that iterates through URLs generated on the website for [Texas' Public Information Act (PIA) Decision Database](https://oag.my.site.com/piaPortal/s/texaspublicinformationactdatabase) to pull all decisions in a specific timeframe. 

We used this scraper to download all the public opinions from the Texas Office of the Attorney General from January 1, 2025 to December 1, 2025 and [upload them to a DocumentCloud project](https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/222413-texas-ag-public-information-act-decisions/). We used (DocumentCloud’s Bulk Upload script)[https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/jan/27/introducing-documentclouds-bulk-upload-script/] to upload the tens of thousands of decisions to DocumentCloud.
